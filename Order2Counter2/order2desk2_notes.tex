\section{Scenario}

A tech company allows its in office employees to order snacks and beverages to their working desk:
\begin{itemize}
\item Workers are assigned a Mac, Windows or Linux computer.
\item They can order food / drinks by means of a Python script \texttt{order2desk.py} that presents a menu on the command-line and accepts their selection(s).
\item The script automatically discovers their username and hostname.
\item Once prepared, their catering partner then brings the order to their desk.
\end{itemize}
In the kitchen:
\begin{itemize}
\item A PC has a Python script that presents each order in sequence on a screen.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Improvements}

The system has been working well, but some improvements are needed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Dynamically loaded menu} replacing the hardcoded beverage options.
\item \textbf{Lambda function} needs to be setup in \textbf{CloudFormation}.
\item \textbf{Resources} should be looked up in CloudFormation and not hardcoded.
\item \textbf{Permissions} need to be scoped to the actual actions on the actual resources.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Dynamic lookup}

We want all components to look up resources from the CloudFormation template:
\begin{itemize}
\item Outputs in CloudFormation template pointing to resources
\item Dynamic lookup using a \texttt{cf\_output} function in Python in \texttt{common.py}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic menu}

\begin{itemize}
\item Menu is defined in a JSON file \texttt{menu.json}.
\item Loaded by \texttt{order2desk.py} from S3 bucket.
\item S3 bucket looked up from CloudFormation. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Permissions}

\begin{center}
  \textbf{What actions do the following components need to perform on what resources?}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Order script \texttt{order2desk.py}
\item Order handler function
\item Monitor script \texttt{monitor.py}
\end{enumerate}
